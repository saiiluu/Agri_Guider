  <h2>Effective Pest Management in Farming</h2>
  <b>
    Pests can cause significant loss to crops and affect overall farm productivity. 
    Effective pest control ensures healthier plants, higher yields, and reduces the need for excessive chemical pesticides. 
    Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines biological, cultural, and chemical methods to manage pests sustainably.

  <br><br>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Why Pest Control Matters?</h3>
    <p>
        Pest control is crucial for maintaining crop health, preventing diseases, and securing food supply. Uncontrolled pests can damage leaves, stems, and roots, leading to reduced growth and lower production. 
        Proper pest management protects the environment and reduces economic losses for farmers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Benefits of Effective Pest Control</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Healthy crops: Prevents crop damage and ensures better growth.</li>
      <li>Higher yield: Reduces losses caused by insects and pathogens.</li>
      <li>Economic savings: Minimizes cost of chemical pesticides.</li>
      <li>Environmental protection: Encourages natural pest predators and reduces chemical pollution.</li>
      <li>Food security: Ensures consistent production of safe and healthy crops.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
    <img src="http://agsci.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/ipm_click_1.jpg" alt="Pest control" class="img-center">
    <p>
        Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an eco-friendly approach to pest control that combines cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods. 
        IPM aims to reduce pest populations while minimizing risks to humans, animals, and the environment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biological control: Using natural predators like ladybugs and parasitic wasps.</li>
      <li>Cultural control: Crop rotation, planting pest-resistant varieties.</li>
      <li>Mechanical control: Traps, barriers, and manual removal of pests.</li>
      <li>Chemical control: Targeted pesticide use when necessary.</li>
      <li>Monitoring: Regular inspection of crops for early pest detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aphids</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ybNvPqcfcu5ebiFeb6bM9A.jpg" alt="Organic pest control" class="img-center">
    <p>
        Aphids are small soft-bodied pear-shaped insects that are usually green but can also appear in other colours such as yellow, pink, purple, and reddish-brown. Some aphid species can have wings, particularly in spring and autumn and when the colony is large. Aphids are generally distinguished from other insects by the presence of cornicles. Cornicles are tube-like structures that point outwards from the body. 
        Aphids can be found as lone insects but only cause damage to plants in higher numbers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Control</b>
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Neem oil spray: Natural insect repellent and fungicide.</li>
      <li>Garlic or chili spray: Repels insects naturally.</li>
      <li>Soap solution: Breaks down aphid’s protective coating, causing dehydration.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <div class="section">
    <h3>Whiteflies</h3>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*YxTM1mO_jAKvEMbpIlkxuA.jpeg" alt="Organic pest control" class="img-center">
    <p>
        Whiteflies are small white or yellow insects that can cause damage to crops. These bugs have wings and can fly but are not considered true flies. In fact, they are more closely related to other insects like aphids,
         and their white color comes from a waxy substance that covers the bodies and wings of adults. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Control</b>
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Neem oil spray: Natural insect repellent and fungicide.</li>
      <li>Insecticidal soap: Breaks down their protective coating.</li>
      <li>Companion planting: Marigolds, basil, and nasturtiums help repel whiteflies.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

   <div class="section">
    <h3>Caterpillars</h3>
    <img src="http://www.wildlifeinsight.com/wp-content/gallery/gb_caterpillars/largewhite_4069.jpg" alt="Organic pest control" class="img-center">
    <p>
        This pest is a species of moth that feeds on cabbage plants in its larval stage. Adult moths are grey or yellowish-brown and have a wingspan of 25 mm. Larvae are blue-grey with many lateral black stripes on their backs. A large black and yellow stripe runs the length of their bodies on each side of the striped area. 
        They feed on all tender parts of cabbage plants but prefer to feed on terminal buds.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Control</b>
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Handpicking: Removing caterpillars manually from plants in small gardens.</li>
      <li>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt): A natural soil bacterium that targets caterpillars without harming beneficial insects.</li>
      <li>Encouraging predators: Birds, wasps, and spiders naturally reduce caterpillar populations.</li>
      <li>Neem oil spray: Acts as a repellent and disrupts feeding.</li>
      <li>Companion planting: Plants like marigolds can deter caterpillars.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Red Spider Mites</h3>
    <img src="https://opticfoliar.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/spider-mites.png" alt="Organic pest control" class="img-center">
    <p>
        ed spider mites are significant pests in many crops and other plants. They typically measure less than a millimeter in length, which makes them difficult to spot. They get their nutrients by attacking leaves, eventually leading to leaf death and reduced yield from the affected crop. These tiny mites are found globally, with many species, such as the southern, spruce, and two-spotted spider mite, prevalent in the continental US.
         Luckily, there are several ways to control red spider mite numbers, including biological methods.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Control</b>
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Water spray: A strong jet of water dislodges mites and washes away webs.</li>
      <li>Neem oil or horticultural oil: Smothers mites and disrupts their feeding.</li>
      <li>Insecticidal soap: Breaks down their protective coating.</li>
      <li>Biological control: Predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) and ladybugs feed on spider mites.</li>
      <li>Companion planting: Plants like marigolds can deter caterpillars.</li>
    </ul>
